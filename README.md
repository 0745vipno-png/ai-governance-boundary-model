## Purpose

This repository documents a responsibility-bound AI execution architecture
focused on auditability, execution boundaries, and explicit human ownership.

## Scope

This repository contains design documentation only.
It does not provide a runnable system, framework, service, or policy proposal.

## Responsibility Model

All execution decisions remain explicitly owned by human operators.
Automation is intentionally constrained to evidence production and controlled execution.
